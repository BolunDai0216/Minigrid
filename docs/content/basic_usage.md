## Basic Usage

There is a UI application which allows you to manually control the agent with the arrow keys:

```
./minigrid/manual_control.py
```

The environment being run can be selected with the `--env` option, eg:

```
./minigrid/manual_control.py --env MiniGrid-Empty-8x8-v0
```

## Training an Agent

If you want to train an agent with reinforcement learning, please refer to the [training tutorial](training.md).
